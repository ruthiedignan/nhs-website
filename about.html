  <p><a class="mission"><i> "The National Honor Society (NHS) elevates a school’s commitment to the values of scholarship, service, leadership, and character. These four pillars have been associated with membership in the organization since its inception in 1921." </i></a></p>
  <p><a class="via"> via the </a><a class="cite" href="https://www.nhs.us/about/">National Honor Society website. </a></p>

  
  <p><a class="information" style="top: 90%; margin-right:700px"> National Honor Society is a student-run organization whose main goal is to fulfill the needs of the community and provide beneficial support, while also advancing student academia and character. </a></p>

  <p><a class="information" style="top: 105%; margin-right:700px"> With a heavy focus on the four pillars of NHS - scholarship, service, leadership, and character - the members are driven to strive for success as they lead and work on monthly projects to maintain a positive community, both in and out of school. </a></p>

  <p><a class="information" style="top: 120%; margin-right: 700px"> At Owosso High School, NHS hosts a variety of school events with members of NHS, non-members, and individuals within the community. Our most notable events include the powderpuff football game, talent shows, Shiawassee river clean-up, carwashes, and more. </a></p>

  <p><a class="information" style="top:90%; left:60%; margin-right: 100px"> Owosso NHS allows students to go beyond the books, encouraging students to design and personalize school events to their own preference, while still raising funds for charitable causes. </a></p>

  <p><a class="information" style="top:105%; left:60%; margin-right: 100px"> The split between the four committees of NHS allows students to target the cause they are passionate about and work primarily in that realm, while also giving options that adapt to all students’ interests. </a></p>

  <p><a class="information" style="top:120%; left:60%; margin-right: 100px"> For sophomores and juniors, or prospective freshmen, interested in joining the Owosso High School National Honor Society, please visit the How to Join page for details involving requirements and the induction process. </a></p>
